# Challenge week 9

## Pokémon

This application will have three pages:

-   All pokémon - name and image of each Pokemon.
-   My pokémon
-   Detail of pokémon

The listing of all pokémon will be fed from the PokéAPI, and should be paginated. The listing should be accompanied by two buttons, for page forward and page backward. It should also show the total number of pokémon displayed vs. the total number of pokémon that exist (e.g. 10/1000).

The user should be able to add the pokémon they want to their local listing. The My pokémon listing will be fed from [a local API](https://github.com/isdi-coders-2022/bootcamp-202201-bcn/tree/master/week3/challenges/pokeapi). The user should be able to remove pokémon from his local listing, and also modify some data.

In any of the listings, the user should be able to go to the detail of a pokémon, where more data will be shown. This detail page is reached by passing an id through the URL (the id of the pokémon we want to see).
